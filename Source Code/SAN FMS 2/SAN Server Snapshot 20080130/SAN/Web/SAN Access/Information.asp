<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p align="left">Welcome to the Commerce IT Storage Area Network (SAN) System. As a staff or 
student related to the Commerce Faculty in the University of Cape Town, you are 
automatically allocated extra network space via the SAN. This portal that you 
are now on allows you to manage your stored files. </p>
<p align="left">To access your files, you will be required to log on to the system. Please 
note that you need to log on using your <font color="#FF0000"><b>normal network 
credentials</b></font>, in other words your <b>staff or student number</b> 
combined with your <b>password</b> that you use to access your email account.</p>
<p align="left">Because the SAN is an online storage space, it means that you can't interact 
with your files like you would if they were simply on the hard drive or on a 
flash disk. Instead you would need to physically upload files to the system and 
then download them when you wish to access them. Of course this means you 
mustn't forget to re-upload them once you are done working. However, this little 
extra bit of work isn't all that bad if you consider that you now have access to 
these files anywhere in the world.</p>
<p align="left">The system is managed and maintained by Commerce IT and should you experience 
any problems with the system, please feel free to contact the helpdesk, either 
personally, telephonically (021 650 3858) or electronically (<a href="mailto:commercehelpdesk@uct.ac.za">commercehelpdesk@uct.ac.za</a>)<br>
